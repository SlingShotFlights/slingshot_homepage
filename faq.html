     <h3>What is SlingShot?</h3>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>SlingShot is your personal concierge for free award travel. We dive deep to analyze your situation and goals. Then, we put together a comprehensive plan to help you get where you're going.</p>
                                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>We think that instead of researching boring blogs and frequent flyer forums, you should read Lonely Planet [Destination].</p>

    <div class="col span_1_of_2">
     <h3>What's your business model? How do you make $?</h3>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Eventually, we'll partner with credit card companies to earn affiliate bonuses for referring our users to specific cards. We pledge to <em>always </em>recommend the card best suited for your needs.</p>
                                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>For now, we're using personal referral links to track signups. SlingShot employees can potentially earn bonuses when you sign up for a card.</p>

    <h3>Free travel? How does this all work?</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Credit card companies and airlines want to win your business. To that end, they work together to offer valuable promotions to acquire new customers - that's you. By taking advantage of these offers, you can earn free travel and hotel stays.</p>
                                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>We advocate for responsible use of credit; to take advantage of these deals (rather than be taken advantage of by these deals!), it's important to make monthly payments on time, and pay off your debt each cycle.</p>

    <h3>How does credit work?</h3>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At SlingShot, we are 100% committed to educating our users on the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to credit. To that end, we devote a <a href="http://www.slingshot.flights/responsible-credit">Responsible Credit</a> page to answering your questions:</p>
