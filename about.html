<h3 class="text-center">Our Mission</h3>
<p>
Folks across the United States are working with an ever tightening budget. They also might have 19,000 miles orphaned across United, Delta and American Airlines frequent flyer accounts. Free reward travel is tremendously exciting - yet impossibly complicated, due to an ever-changing ecosystem of multiple programs and offers, airline alliances, and award redemption charts.</p>
 
<p>SlingShot is here to make it easy. We collect your preferred destinations, spending patterns, credit info and more across 20+ data points, then turn it into a custom-tailored, actionable plan to get you to your destination - for free (+ taxes, of course - Uncle Sam always wants his cut).</p>
 
<p>We're on a mission to help more people visit more places, as we show America that responsible use of credit can open the door to traveling the world.</p>

<h3>Our Values</h3>
<p>
We believe that new travel experiences shape us and that forging connections with locals and other travelers expands our worldview. We believe that travel makes the world a smaller place and fosters communication among people from different cultures, building a more global community.</p>

<p>We also believe that everyone should have the opportunity to travel. Our lives have been greatly enriched by travel that was often free or deeply discounted, and our passion lies in creating similar experiences for our customers through smart financial strategies.</p>
 
<hr>

<h3>Our Commitment to You</h3>
<p>
We create a personalized travel strategy that saves you hours of research and uncovers reward travel opportunities. To do this, we draw on our extensive knowledge of travel loyalty programs and credit card products that earn travel rewards. Then we deconstruct it all for you into a custom, step-by-step plan.</p>
 
<p>We do this by analyzing information you provide us about your travel preferences, frequent flyer program participation, credit and spending habits. We then evaluate relevant credit card products with opportunities to collect loyalty program points and recommend the right option for you.</p>
 
<p>Our plans often recommend that you sign up for a credit card to jump-start your reward points balance. We strongly advocate for <a href="http://www.slingshot.flights/responsible-credit">responsible use of credit</a> and credit education.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll be here along the way to keep you on track with your plan and ensure that you realize your travel dreams!</p>
